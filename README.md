# 🏓 Classic Pong Game in Python

A retro two-player Pong Game built with Python’s `turtle` module. This project implements clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), collision detection, score tracking, and responsive controls — bringing back the arcade vibes with modern modular code.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Two-player paddle control:
  - Player 1 → `W` / `S`
  - Player 2 → `↑` / `↓`
- Ball speed increases after every bounce
- Score resets after every round
- Randomized ball direction after each reset
- Fully OOP: Separated classes for `Paddle`, `Ball`, and `ScoreBoard`
- Frame-by-frame game update with smooth motion

---

## 🧠 Built With:
- Python `turtle` module
- OOP (Classes & Inheritance)
- Collision Detection & Randomization
- Real-time game loop handling
- Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python Bootcamp (Day 22)

---

## 🎮 How to Play
- Run `main.py`
- Player 1: Use `W` (up) and `S` (down)
- Player 2: Use `↑` and `↓` arrow keys
- First to miss gives a point to the opponent
- The ball resets automatically and the fun continues!
